# Hapara Cache Exercise - JavaScript Version

This is the JS version of the "Last Recently Used Cache" exercise for a job interview at Hapara.

To use this, you can download it and open the index.html file in your browser of choice, or run it on specific server. 

The cache usage examples are outputted on the Console window of any modern browser, but you can use the "LRUCache.js" file by itself 
if you don't want to include the examples.
